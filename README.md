# Anonymous-Graffiti

A Java Android app for taking photos, editing them, and sharing them with your community! Built as a final project with one partner for UNC's Mobile Computing Systems class. Users can take photos and edit them similar to snapchat, and then can save them to their particular location. To view photos and your 'Graffiti', you must be in the same location as where the photo was taken.

Employs a SQLite database to store photos, edits, long/lat, etc. Uses Google Locations API to determine whether to show user photos.
